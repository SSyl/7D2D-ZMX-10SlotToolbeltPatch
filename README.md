**Note:**
The 10 Slot Toolbelt mod, which can be found [here](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?134674-10-Slot-Toolbelt!-(A18)), is a DMT mod and must be compiled in order to work at all. Installing this SMX or this patch will not enable the 10 slot toolbelt until you properly install the 10 Slot Toolbelt mod.
